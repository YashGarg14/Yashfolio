      Back in college, I was just curious about how websites work. I’d inspect
      elements on pages and try to break things (and sometimes fix them). My
      first "website" was just a bunch of divs and colors that made no sense—but
      I was hooked. I had no idea what a responsive layout or a good UX meant,
      but I loved seeing code come alive on the screen.
